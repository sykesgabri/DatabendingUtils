# DatabendingUtils

This program allows users to databend images using either the TIFF or BMP format. Databending is a technique that involves manipulating image files with audio effects to create unique and glitched visuals.

## Dependencies
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- colorama library

You can install the colorama library by running the following command:
```
pip install colorama
```

## Running the Program
1. Clone this git repository, either with `git clone https://github.com/sykesgabri/DatabendingUtils` or by downloading as a zip.
2. Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed (Python and colorama).
3. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to DatabendingUtils.
4. Run the program with `python3 main.py`

## Databending Tutorial
For a detailed tutorial on how to perform databending with audacity, which this program instructs you to use, you can refer to the following YouTube video:

This tutorial covers the steps for applying effects to image data, important considerations while databending, and additional tips to help you get started with databending photographs.

Please note that the current version of this program generates corrupted TIFF files. I am aware of this issue and working on a fix. In the meantime, it is recommended to use the BMP mode for glitching images.
