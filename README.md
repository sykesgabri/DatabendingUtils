# IMPORTANT
This version of the program is the deprecated Python version, this repo will remain available for archival purposes, but will no longer be updated. For the new version of this program, written in Rust, go [here](https://github.com/sykesgabri/databendingutils-rs).

# DatabendingUtils

This program converts most images into a format ready for databending. You can choose between BMP or TIFF, which both have different and unique properties when databending.

## Dependencies
To run this program, you need to have the following dependencies installed:
- Python (version 3.0 or higher)
- colorama
- LibTIFF

You can install colorama by running the following command:

`pip install colorama`

As for LibTIFF, it depends on your OS:

## Databending Tutorial
For a detailed tutorial on how to perform databending with audacity, which this program instructs you to use, you can refer to the following YouTube video:

### IMPORTANT NOTES ON TIFF IMAGES
The TIFF images generated by this program do not have their headers and IFD's removed automatically, this is because TIFF is a weird format and I can't figure out how the fuck its metadata works. You can still databend TIFF images generated by this program, however you need to be careful not to alter two parts of the waveform:
